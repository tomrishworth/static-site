  "readme": "# grunt-libsass\n\n> Fast grunt sass compiler using libsass via node-sass\n\n## Getting Started\nThis plugin requires Grunt `0.4.0`\n\nIf you haven't used [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) before, be sure to check out the [Getting Started](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) guide, as it explains how to create a [Gruntfile](http://gruntjs.com/sample-gruntfile) as well as install and use Grunt plugins. Once you're familiar with that process, you may install this plugin with this command:\n\n```shell\nnpm install grunt-libsass --save-dev\n```\n\nOnce the plugin has been installed, it may be enabled inside your Gruntfile with this line of JavaScript:\n\n```js\ngrunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-libsass');\n```\n\n## The \"libsass\" task\n\n*Run this task with the grunt libsass command*\n\nThis plugin automates fast compilation of scss files using [libsass](https://github.com/hcatlin/libsass) via the\n[node-sass](https://github.com/andrew/node-sass) module. It aims to make coexistence with and transition from the\n[grunt-contrib-sass](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-sass) library as painless as possible.\n\n**Please not that grunt-libsass is incomplete and only very lightly tested at this point.**\n\n### Sass compatibility\n\nAs noted in the documentation for the node-sass module\n\n> The libsass library is not currently at feature parity with the 3.2 Ruby Gem that most Sass users will use,\n> and has little-to-no support for 3.3 syntax.\n\nIn other words, you may find that there are scss files it cannot compile and if there are sass 3.3 features you simply\n*must* have then the afforementioned grunt-contrib-sass plugin would be a better choice.\n\n### Options\n\n#### options.loadPath\nType: `[String]`\nDefault value: `[]`\n\nAn array of paths to search for files to @import\n\n### options.sourcemap\nType: `[String]`\nDefault value `false`\n\nWhen set to true a sourcemap named &lt;css-file-name&gt;.map will be generated in the same location as the compiled css\nfile.\n\n\n### Usage Examples\n\n#### Compile a single file\nIn this example, the default options are used to compile a sass file\n\n```js\ngrunt.initConfig({\n  libsass: {\n      myTarget{\n          src: 'src/my.scss'\n          dest: 'dist/my.css',\n      }\n  }\n});\n```\n\n#### Compile all files in a directory, with an loadPath set\nIn this example, all the scss files in a directory will be compiled. Paths are set to search for files to @import\n\n```js\ngrunt.initConfig({\n  libsass: {\n    options: {\n      loadPath: ['my/load/path']\n    },\n    files: {[\n        {\n            expand: true,\n            cwd: 'my/src/dir',\n            src: ['**/*.scss'],\n            dest: 'dist',\n            ext: '.css'\n        }\n    ]},\n  }\n});\n```\n\n## Contributing\nIn lieu of a formal styleguide, take care to maintain the existing coding style. Add unit tests for any new or changed functionality. Lint and test your code using [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/).\n\n## Release History\n0.1.0 Alpha release. Limited functionality.\n\n0.1.1 Better documentation\n\n0.1.2 Screwed up 0.1.1 ...\n\n0.2.0 Added sourcemap option\n",
